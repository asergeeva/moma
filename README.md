# The MoMA Collection As It Relates to Me
 
As an artist I was curious to learn: what are my own personal odds of getting into the group of 15,222 artists whose work is represented in the MoMA Collection? Given that the artist bio includes nationality, birth country (if other than their classified nationality) as well as gender, I was interested in using both metrics to understand my own percentage.

How many of these artists are women?
How many are from Ukraine?
How many are both?
And who are they?
